# City Air Quality & Health App
The City Air Quality & Health app was built as part of a codeathon competition sponsored by Kaiser Permanente and Microsoft to build apps related to public health and wellness. The codeathon details can be found online at https://www.eventbrite.com/e/health-and-wellness-designed-by-you-tickets-16865777996 

The City Air Quality & Health app compares two cities side by side with respect to air quality trends, green spaces, and health outcomes. The app is still in development, but it can be seen online at https://gaurbans.shinyapps.io/CityAirQualityHealth 

The app was built using R and Shiny. The code is in the file app.R, while the remainder of the files in this repository are data supporting the app.
